# Overview

This is a version of the card game blackjack. I made this game in an effort to teach myslef the Kotlin programming language, with the idea that maybe I could go on to make an android app of this game.

The game right now is just a text-based game that you play in the terminal. It doesn't work very well as a game, but it served as a proof of concpet for the logic involved.

Here is a video demonstration and walkthrough of the code:

# Development Environment

This Kotlin program was written in teh IntelliJ IDE. No external libraries were used; it is all vanilla Kotlin.

# Useful Resourceses

In the course of this project, I found the following resources useful:
* [The official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
* [This in-depth YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UC9DY-vIU)

# Future Work

* There are still a few bugs to fix, as demonstrated in the video
* At some point, I would like to make a multi-player mobile app for this game, with appropriate graphics for a card game.
